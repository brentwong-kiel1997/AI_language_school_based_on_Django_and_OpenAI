### Disclaimer
**Please do not share the YouTube videos downloaded using this project.**

Once the video is transcribed, the program will delete the original video and audio.
If you need to share the videos along with the materials, please share them via 
**YouTube link** or add the original video via **YouTube Embedding function**.
Make sure each time the videos are played, the original creators can benefit from those views.

The materials generated from the programming are considered as **commentaries**.
